# Attempt Details

## Tool
- Name: Claude
- Version: [version used]
- Configuration: [any specific settings]

## Prompt Strategy
### Initial Prompt
```
/resources folder contains all the relevant context for developing Hyperware applications. Make sure to parse it, and add a configuration spec in Claude.md as a reference for yourself (for anything you might
   need). I want you to make a simple chat application (with both the backend and frontend (UI) configured. I want to be able to add people as contacts, and chat with my contacts, and be able to create 
  groupchats.
```

### Follow-up Prompts (if needed)
1. First follow-up:
   ```
   The WIT file is automatically generated based on your application. Make sure to use the built-in contacts mechanism for managing contacts.
   ```
2. Second follow-up:
   ```
   [Follow-up prompt 2]
   ```
