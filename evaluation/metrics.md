# Evaluation Framework

## Scoring System
Each tool is evaluated on a scale of 1-5 for each metric:
1. Poor
2. Below Average
3. Average
4. Good
5. Excellent

## Core Metrics

### Success Rate (Weight: 30%)
- 5: Complete success, all requirements met
- 3: Partial success, core functionality achieved
- 1: Failed to achieve core objectives

### Accuracy (Weight: 20%)
- 5: Perfect implementation, matches requirements exactly
- 3: Minor deviations but functionally correct
- 1: Major deviations or incorrect implementation

### Efficiency (Weight: 15%)
- 5: One-shot success or minimal iterations
- 3: Moderate number of iterations needed
- 1: Excessive iterations or unable to complete

### Code Quality (Weight: 15%)
- 5: Production-ready, follows all best practices
- 3: Acceptable quality, some improvements needed
- 1: Poor quality, major refactoring needed

### Error Handling (Weight: 10%)
- 5: Comprehensive error handling and edge cases
- 3: Basic error handling implemented
- 1: No error handling

### Documentation (Weight: 10%)
- 5: Comprehensive, clear documentation
- 3: Basic documentation present
- 1: Poor or no documentation

## Calculating Overall Score
Final Score = Σ (Metric Score × Weight)

## Comparative Analysis
For each task, tools will be ranked based on:
1. Overall weighted score
2. Performance in individual metrics
3. Time to completion
4. Resource utilization

## Additional Considerations
- Tool-specific strengths/weaknesses
- Task complexity impact
- Learning curve
- Cost considerations
